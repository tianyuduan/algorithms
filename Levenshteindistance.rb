# Rally Health / Software Engineer, Entery Level
#
# At Rally, we pride ourselves in putting health in the hands of the individual. That energy permeates everything we do.
#
# Your problem today is to make that happen -- literally.
#
# You’ve probably heard of the Levenshtein distance between strings (if you haven’t, no problem! Check it out on Wikipedia).  Your task is to transform one word into another, with four operations: add a letter, delete a letter, change a letter, and take an anagram of the existing word.  Additionally, you have to obey the following rules:
#
# Every interim step between the first and the last word must also be a word
# No interim step can be less than three letters
# The first line of input will contain the “cost” of each operation in the order above
# The second line of input will contain the starting word
# The third line of input will contain the ending word
#
# Your goal is to find the lowest possible “cost” of transforming the starting word into the ending word.  You can use any word list you like -- feel free to include your word list or a link to it as part of your solution. (Depending on your word list, your answer might not be exactly the same as ours below.)
#
# Your solution should detect and handle invalid input, and return -1 if there is no solution.
#
# Example input:
#
# 1 3 1 5
# HEALTH
# HANDS
# (output: 7) (HEALTH - HEATH - HEATS - HENTS - HENDS - HANDS)
# (If your dictionary doesn’t have a couple of these words in there, don’t worry -- you’re scored on your code, not your word list.)
#
# 1 9 1 3
# TEAM
# MATE
# (output: 3) (TEAM - MATE)
#
# 7 1 5 2
# OPHTHALMOLOGY
# GLASSES
# (output: -1)
